# EMBL Advanced Deep Learning for Image Analysis 2025

## Schedule:

- Webinar 1: Monday 13th January  14:00 - 15:00 CET  
- Webinar 2: Monday 20th January  14:00 - 15:00 CET  
- Webinar 3: Monday 3rd February 14:00 - 15:00 CET  

## Set-up:

We will use on-premise EMBL resources (BARD) for the course. You can also use google colab to run the U-Net notebooks if you prefer. However, it might make sense to familiarise yourself with BARD as this is what you will be using during the course.

## BARD

You will all be given a login to a BARD account, working within this VM you can clone the git repo to your home folder and complete the exercises. More details will be given in precourse webinar 1 and can be found on the ecampus page or youcan always ask if you have other questions.
