# Exercises for Webinar 3

We provide exercises in pytorch. Work through all the exercises.

## Pytorch

In the first two exercises we follow up on the exercises from webinar 2 and implement a CNN and data augmentation for image classification on the cifar dataset.
The last exercise provides an introduction to image segmentation with a U-net to prepare us for the course and introduce a very important method for bioimage analysis.

For the pytorch exercises, please use the `DL Course(Pytorch)` environment in BAND. You can start it via `Applications->Programming->DL Course(Pytorch)`.
