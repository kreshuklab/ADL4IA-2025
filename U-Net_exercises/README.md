# Exercises for U-Net

We provide exercises in pytorch. You should work through all the exercises before the 3rd Webinar session. during the webinar we will have a Q&A session to answer any questions youo may have about the notebooks or exercises.

## Pytorch

In the first two exercises we implement a CNN and data augmentation for image classification on the cifar dataset.
The last exercise provides an introduction to image segmentation with a U-net to prepare us for the course and introduce a very important method for bioimage analysis.

For the exercises, please use the `pytorch` environment in BARD. Or you can use the environment yaml to create a suitbale conda environment if you are working somewhere else.
